# Numerical Simulations and Visualizations

This repository contains numerical projects combining **applied mathematics**, **physics**, and **scientific visualization**.

## Project Highlights
- Numerical solutions to **Partial Differential Equations** (PDEs) using **finite difference methods**.
- **Interactive visualizations** with **Matplotlib**:  
  - 2D vector fields and gradient plots  
  - 3D surface plots with dynamic camera perspectives  
  - Sliders to modify parameters in real-time  
  - Animated simulations of physical processes
- Custom-built animations saved as **MP4** or **GIFs**.

## Technologies
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Matplotlib Widgets (Slider, Buttons)
- FFmpeg (for high-quality video exports)

## What You Will Find
- Explicit time-stepping solvers for PDEs
- Animated thermal diffusion
- Visual intuition for vector fields and gradients
- Dynamic 3D plots linked to 2D parameter planes
- Ready-to-adapt templates for scientific simulations

## Purpose
These projects were created to:
- Strengthen my understanding of numerical analysis
- Build strong foundations for advanced topics like **Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**
- Improve my skills in scientific programming and data visualization
- Make math **interactive**, **beautiful**, and **intuitive**
